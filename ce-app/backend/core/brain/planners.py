"""Planners: the candidates that race.

Two of them today, both producing the same thing — an ordered list of
`Pick`s, one per shot the template asks for:

* `rule_plan` is deterministic, offline, and always in the race. It is the floor
  the language model has to beat, which is what makes the race safe: a bad or
  slow model can never make the result worse than the offline answer.
* `ollama_plan` asks a local model to *choose and order* moments from the
  measured list. It is handed text only — the transcript, the measured strength
  of each candidate moment, the target rhythm — because a model that cannot see
  the picture must not be asked about the picture.

The model returns indices into the measured list, never timings of its own. That
is the whole safety property: it cannot invent a moment that does not exist, and
the worst it can do is pick a poor order, which the judge then scores lower than
the rule plan.
