"""Is the local AI actually there, and is it usable?

Two optional engines make the difference between "the app works" and "the app is
clever": Ollama for judgement over text, faster-whisper for speech. Both are
local, both are large, and both are easy to have *almost* installed — a model
never pulled, a service not running, a first call that takes ninety seconds.

This router answers three questions honestly, with numbers rather than a green
tick: is it installed, is it reachable, and how fast is it on *this* machine.
