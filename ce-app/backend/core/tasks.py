"""Long work with a face: staged progress, a poll answer, and a cancel button.

Style analysis and a styled rebuild take tens of seconds on a long reference —
sometimes minutes when captions are involved. Until 0.6.0 both were a single
synchronous request against a client with a 30 second budget, which is the same
shape as the failure the user reported in 0.5.3 (`timeout of 30000ms exceeded`):
the work was fine, the request was not.

So the work moves here. A task runs on a worker thread, reports the stage it is
in over the WebSocket every screen is already listening to, can be polled if that
socket dropped, and can be cancelled — which really does kill the FFmpeg child,
not just stop reporting.

Nothing here is persisted: a task is alive for the session that started it. The
result is fetched over HTTP rather than broadcast, because an editor document is
far too big to push through a status channel.
