"""The graphics card, used where it helps and reported honestly.

The owner's instruction: *"I have a GTX 1650. Do not limit the GPU anywhere —
use it wherever it is needed."* Fair, and until now we did the opposite in three
places:

* the compositor decided NVENC was available by **grepping FFmpeg's encoder
  list**, which lists `h264_nvenc` on machines whose driver cannot run it, so
  the choice was a guess in both directions;
* nothing ever used the card for **decoding**, which is most of the work in
  building a proxy or scanning a file;
* `/api/system/doctor` returned `"cuda": {"available": false}` as a **hard-coded
  literal**, so the diagnostics screen told a user with a working card that they
  had none.

Everything here is a *probe*, never a guess: the encoder is asked to encode one
real frame, the decoder is asked to decode one real file, and `nvidia-smi` is
read only for the label. Results are cached for the life of the process, because
probing costs about a second and the answer cannot change while the app runs.

This module never raises: a machine with no card is the normal case, and it must
come back as "no", not as an error.
