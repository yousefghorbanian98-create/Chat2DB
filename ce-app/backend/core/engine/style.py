"""Style analysis: turn a reference video into a template, and a template into an edit.

Two questions, one module:

* **What is this video made of?** Shot lengths, whether the cuts land on the beat,
  how the camera moves in each shot, the colour, where the speech sits, how loud
  the music is under it.
* **What would my footage look like edited that way?** Pick the strongest moments
  of the user's own material and lay them out to the same rhythm, with the same
  framing decisions, look and transitions.

Deliberately dependency-free: frames are decoded by FFmpeg into small grayscale
buffers and everything else is NumPy. OpenCV is not importable on every machine
(it needs libGL), and a style analyser that only runs on some installs is worse
than one that is a little simpler.

Nothing here copies the reference: the template is numbers and names.
