"""The race: every planner answers, arithmetic decides.

    rule plan 0.71 · ollama:qwen2.5 0.83 → used ollama:qwen2.5

That line is the point of this module. It is written into the result, shown in
the app, and it is the honest answer to "did the AI actually help?" — sometimes
it is "no", and then the offline plan is used and says so.

Two guarantees this file exists to keep:

1. **The rule plan is always a candidate.** A language model can only win by
   scoring higher; it can never make the output worse than the offline result.
2. **A tie goes to the rules.** Determinism is worth more than novelty when the
   numbers say the two plans are equally good.
