"""Which moment is worth keeping — read from what was said, not how loud it was.

Until now the strongest moment was the longest stretch of speech or the busiest
picture. That finds the loud parts; it does not find the part where the point is
made. This module reads the transcript and scores each moment on the things that
mark meaning in a sentence, in English and Persian:

* **discourse markers** — "but", "the most important", "because", "so",
  «اما», «مهم‌ترین», «چون», «در نتیجه». These are where an argument turns.
* **questions** — a question sets up an answer, which is a hook.
* **numbers and names** — concrete claims survive being cut out of context.
* **completeness** — a fragment that starts mid-sentence reads as an accident.
* **density** — words per second, so a long pause is not mistaken for content.

It is not understanding. It is a measurable proxy for it, and it is only *part*
of the score: `core.brain.objective` still weighs duration, rhythm and silence,
and the local model in `core.brain.planners` still gets its say. A model that is
not installed changes nothing here — this runs offline, on text we already have.
