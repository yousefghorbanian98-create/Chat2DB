"""The brain: does the judge measure, and can the race make things worse?

Every fixture here has a right answer built into it, because the whole point of
an objective score is that it is not a matter of taste:

* a plan that matches the target exactly must score higher than one that does not,
* a cut through the middle of a word must cost points,
* a term that cannot be measured must be *dropped*, not invented,
* and the race must never return something worse than the offline rule plan —
  that is the property that makes putting a language model in the loop safe.
