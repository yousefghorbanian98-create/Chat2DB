"""Auto-reframe: keep the speaker in the frame when the shape changes.

Turning a 16:9 recording into 9:16 throws away two thirds of the width. Until
now we threw away the *sides*, which is right only when the subject stands in
the middle — the honest name for that is a centre crop, and it is what the
`Face Tracking` tile has been doing behind a `BETA` badge.

This module measures where the face actually is and produces a **camera path**
for it. Three deliberate choices:

* **Detection is offline and bundled.** OpenCV's Haar cascades ship inside the
  `opencv-python-headless` wheel we already pin (17 of them, 930 KB for the
  frontal-face one), so nothing is downloaded on the user's machine and the
  feature works on a laptop with no network and no GPU. MediaPipe would be more
  accurate; it also drags in ~160 MB of transitive wheels and a model file
  fetched at runtime, which is a different trade than the one we want here.
* **The result is keyframes, not a special render path.** The path becomes `x`
  keyframes on the clip — the same five channels the editor already animates and
  the exporter already reproduces. So the user can *see* the camera move on the
  timeline, drag a key, or delete the whole thing. An auto-reframe that cannot
  be corrected by hand is a worse feature than one that can.
* **A jittery path is worse than no path.** Raw per-frame detections wobble by a
  few pixels; a camera that wobbles reads as broken. The path is smoothed with a
  deadband (small movements are ignored entirely), an exponential filter, and a
  speed limit, and the result is measured in `tests/test_reframe.py`.
