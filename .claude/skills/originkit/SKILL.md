Browse and import animated components from Originkit's free library of 50 components.

## What Originkit is

Originkit (originkit.dev) is a free animated component library for modern websites. It offers 50 animated React components across 6 categories: interactive elements, image galleries, text effects, animations, background animations, and buttons. Components can be used in Framer, React, Next.js, or Vite projects, with CSS, Tailwind, or CSS Modules styling.

## Setup: getting an API key

Browsing the library does **not** require an API key. Fetching component source code does.

To get a free API key:

1. Go to https://originkit.dev
2. Create an account or log in
3. Open **Settings > API Integration**
4. Copy your API key (it looks like `cmp_live_...`)

Then either:
- Call `originkit_setup` with action `"set"` to enter it for the current session, or
- Add it to the plugin's `config.json` for persistence: `{ "apiKey": "cmp_live_..." }`

You can also just call `originkit_get` for any component and the user will be prompted automatically.

**Daily limit:** 10 component fetches per API key per day, resets at midnight UTC. This limit is shared between MCP and website copies.

## Workflow

### Browse the library

Call `originkit_browse` to list or search components. It works without an API key.

- Pass `query` to search across names, descriptions, and tags (e.g. "particle", "text hover", "gallery").
- Pass `category` to filter by one of: `interactive-elements`, `image-gallery`, `text`, `animation`, `background-animation`, `button`.
- No arguments returns all 50 components grouped by category.

Present results in a readable format. Each component shows its display name, kebab-case identifier (needed for fetching), category, dependencies, and a one-line description.

### Fetch a component

Once the user picks a component, call `originkit_get` with:

- `name` (required): the kebab-case component name from browse results.
- `stack` (optional, default `react`): `framer`, `react`, `nextjs`, or `vite`.
- `styling` (optional, default `css`): `css`, `tailwind`, or `cssmodules`.
- `typescript` (optional, default `true`): TypeScript or JavaScript output.

If no API key is stored, the user is prompted to enter one via a secure field. The key is saved for future use.

The returned content includes the component source code and any CSS or config files. Some components depend on `framer-motion` — mention this when relevant.

### Manage the API key

- `originkit_setup` with action `"status"`: check if a key is configured.
- `originkit_setup` with action `"set"`: prompt for a new key.
- `originkit_setup` with action `"reset"`: clear the stored key.

## Tips

- Always browse first when the user is exploring. It is free and instant.
- When the user names a component they found on the Originkit website, fetch it directly with `originkit_get`.
- If a fetch fails with a daily limit message, let the user know they can try again after midnight UTC.
- If a fetch fails with an auth error, suggest resetting the key via `originkit_setup`.
- Components are React-based. For non-React projects, the `framer` stack variant may be more appropriate.
