"""Auto-reframe: does the frame actually follow the face, and does it do it calmly?

The fixture is built to a recipe, so there is a right answer: a real photograph
of a face is composited onto a wide canvas and moved along a known path. The
test then asks the two questions that decide whether this feature is real:

1. does the camera end up where the face is (measured in pixels of error), and
2. does it move smoothly enough that a person would not call it broken?

Until now `Face Tracking` was a centre crop with a BETA badge.
